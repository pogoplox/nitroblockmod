# Nitro Block Mod for BTA!

Basically, I was inspired by the nitro block from the Crash Bandicoot games.

It is very similar to the default TNT block but has a few differences:
- It explodes instantly
- It explodes when the player or any other entity touches it. (Item entities are an exception)
- The only way to break it is by using shears; otherwise it will explode.
- It's more powerfull than TNT
